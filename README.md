# Sales-Report-Project
## POWER BI Sales Report project for Daily Needs Grocery Store
## Overview
Daily Needs Grocery store desired insights into the performance of their consumables based on the fat content level in the consumables .
## Data Collection
The sales records for the items were collected in a spreadsheet and delivered as an .XLS file.
## Process
### Data Preparation
I imported the data into POWER BI. I started by looking through the data to identify inconsistencies that needed.  to be reconciled . For this, I I used the power query tool built into power bi. I first identified data types that were not properly allocated and made the appropriate corrections.
I continued by making sure that the naming of the values were consistent and made relevant adjustments .
It was then time to make calculations of the Key Performance Indicators KPIs. I did thus by using various DAX FUNCTIONS.
To better integrate the data I created a relationship between all of the KPIs calculated and the original data provided using the modelling tool. This allowed me to create an entire section in the Dashboard that is filterable by the KPIs

## VISUALISATION
I started the visualisations with the KPIs. I decided on making these visuals as cards for its simplicity and easy understanding.
Other visualisations to have insight into performance of the various store locations, size of the outlet, outlet type and year of establishment of the outlet were also done with appropriate charts.
Finally, I set up a filters section where the dashboard can be formatted to display insights as per the desired outlet location, the size of the outlet location and the type of commodity being considered.
Further formatting was done yo make the dashboard more interactive .
Finally the color scheme chosen for the project is pleasant and various a few SVGs were used to make the dashboard even more appealing. I really enjoyed working on this project and I am certain you will have a great time going through the project as well.
